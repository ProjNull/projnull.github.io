<p>Hi there! I just set up wordpress hosting for projnull. As you can see it's pretty much all default. <strong>But</strong> <strong>don't worry</strong> John is here! Working on custom theme based on our original site.</p>

<p>So from now on I will try my best to post web logs (based on Devlogs) where I will inform you about the state of this website.</p>
