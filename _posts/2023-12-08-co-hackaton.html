<p class="has-text-align-left">The Co-Hackaton we participated in was quite unique, the location was the tech tower of Pilzen...<br />Most of {NULL} team met up at school with some other students, then we "stole" stome useful technologies and headed out, on the way to the train station "Patrik"? Had an accidental slide on the ice while holding a monitor, which crerated a "monitor puzzle". after we arrived in Pilsen we headed to the tech tower via tram. We met up with the rest at the location. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">After arriving we could get some coffee/tea if wanted, and some side food. Soon after the event began, they told us that hey had five sponsors, but only two were introduced: RTSoft, CIE.<br />Afterwards we learned that a total of 8 schools are gonna participate totaling to a total of 70 participatns.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">The orhganizators told us that we were going to work on something to help the hospital in Pilsen.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} --></p>
<p class="has-text-align-left">They gave us three themes to choose from:</p>
<p><strong>The first</strong> was to create something that would help people know what they are in for and to help them be not as bored...</p>
<p><strong>The second</strong> was to create a personal pacient card, an online card for pacients to vent their emotions if the don't feel like talking to the nurses, they write the specifics like how they feel or if there is something they want. Nurses have permisions to enter these "cards" to check on the feelings and needs, and think of someway to help.</p>
<p><strong>The third</strong> was to create a game version of some of the hospital things, like the way through the hospital and some of the things awaiting you, or for example: a quiz to guess what belongs in used hospital tools.<br />They could earn points for that or something...</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">The organizators, Sitport, wanted us to get into 10 teams of min. 4 and max. 8 per team preferably between different schools to get extra points ;)<br />For us, it was {NULL} plus one additional person from Slovakia (A chill dude) that helped with design and other things like FrontEnd and the presentation<br />We chose the second theme, the pacient personal card</p>

<p>Every team stole themselves a personal whiteboard free of charge from the organizators, and used it until the end of the event</p>
