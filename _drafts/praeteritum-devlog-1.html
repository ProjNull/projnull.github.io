<p>You've probably seen <a href="https://projnull.mobilex1122.eu/2023/10/12/hackaton-2023/" data-type="post" data-id="86">the blog post the G+SOÅ  Hackathon 2023</a>. If not, don't worry, because we'll cover all the important parts here anyway.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At the hackathon we were part of earlier this month, we chose a theme that involved creating a web application to streamline retrospectives, either as part of AGILE or as a general tool to gather feedback from clients, students, and others.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While we did have a "working" prototype that allowed us to authenticate, add, and view feedback on a single board, the backend codebase was a mess, and the frontend's CSS was different for every route. As a result, although it was functional, we didn't want to continue maintaining the codebase.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where to from here</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since the codebase is a mess rivaling only that of Project Sapphire, we archived our progress in a legacy branch, locked it, and have abandoned it to never be committed to or merged ever again.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We have decided to undertake a complete rewrite of Praeteritum, starting with project setup. As of writing this blog post, we are reorganizing tasks on our kanban board.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the issues we encountered during the hackathon was that tasks were either too generic or overly large. This led to the developer assigned to the task not being sure about what to do. Another issue was that our codebase had almost every possible naming convention, and, lastly, although we did use branches, we could utilize them more effectively this time.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>We will post new devlogs as the project progresses. If you are interested in observing this endeavor or would like to contribute your self, checkout the GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/ProjNull/Praeteritum">ProjNull/Praeteritum</a></p>
